62. Unique Paths
A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

How many possible unique paths are there?


Above is a 7 x 3 grid. How many possible unique paths are there?

Note: m and n will be at most 100.

Example 1:

Input: m = 3, n = 2
Output: 3
Explanation:
From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Right -> Down
2. Right -> Down -> Right
3. Down -> Right -> Right
Example 2:

Input: m = 7, n = 3
Output: 28

var uniquePaths = function(m, n) {
    const dp = new Array(n).fill(new Array(m).fill(1));

    for(let i = 1; i < n; i++){
        for(let j = 1; j < m; j++){
            dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1];
        }
    }

    return dp[n-1][m-1];
};
